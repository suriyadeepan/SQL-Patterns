# SQL Common Patterns

- Creating and inserting data into SQL tables
- Calculating aggregates such as `AVG`, `SUM`, and `COUNT`
- Using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` for grouping data and filtering groups
- Ordering query results using `ORDER BY`
- Extracting parts of dates using `EXTRACT(MONTH, YEAR)`
- Filtering data with `WHERE` and subqueries
- Using `JOIN` operations to combine data from multiple tables
- Using `CASE` statements for conditional logic within queries
- Working with `DECIMAL`, `DATE`, and `DATETIME` data types
